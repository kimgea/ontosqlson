# Entschema (entschema/Python-entity-schema)  
## Not finished / Iced

Creating schema mappings for entity objects. CRUD operations on entities plus validation, and mapping from and to json (an maybe other objects in the future). Supports nested entities and the same operations on them. 

Not worked on in years and not going to be worked on again. Was just a fun project. If you need something similar just use dataclasses, attrs, pydantic, or whatever fits you needs.
